# Keylogger - Capturing Key Strokes

This is a simple Python project that captures key strokes and logs them in both a text file and a JSON file. It uses the Tkinter and customtkinter library for creating a modern graphical user interface (GUI) and the pynput library for tracking keyboard inputs.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You also need to install the following libraries:

- tkinter: This library is usually included with Python installations.
- customtkinter: A custom library for creating modern GUI.
- pynput: A library for tracking keyboard inputs.
- json: A library for working with JSON files.

You can install the required libraries using pip, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install tkinter customtkinter pynput
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files from the GitHub repository: (https://github.com/divyasharma0304/KeyLogger)
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the keylogger:

```
python Keylogger.py
```

1. The GUI window will appear with a "Start" button.
2. Press the "Start" button to initiate the keylogging process.
3. The keylogger will start capturing key strokes.
4. The captured key strokes will be saved in both a text file named "logs.txt" and a JSON file named "logs.json". Note that only released key strokes will be saved in text file while the json file will contain all the information such as pressed, held and released key strokes.

**Note:** Be aware of the legal and ethical implications of using a keylogger. Make sure to comply with all applicable laws and obtain proper authorization before using this software.
